# Bike-Sharing Programs:  Analyzing NYC Citi Bike-Sharing Data to Pitch Bike-Sharing in Des Moines, Iowa. 

## Overview of Project
After traveling with my friend Kate to NYC this past August and having a blast riding bikes sightseeing around the city using the Citi bike-sharing bikes we thought what a great program this would be in our town of Des Moines, Iowa.  As luck would have it we now have a scheduled presentation to make a pitch to investors as a key step to bring a similar bike-sharing program to Des Moines.  

Kate suggested that I use Citi Bike data that has been released to the public for the analysis.  This sounds logical but we will also need to keep in mind that New York City is much different than Des Moines.  How we choose to analyze and present the Citi bike-sharing data will paint a solid picture, but we'll also need to relate the analyis to demographics, geography and weather of Des Moines. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.  One of the key stakeholders has requested to see a bike trip analysis.  We have decided an effective tool to use for this pitch is Tableau and to create a Tableau story to present to the stakeholders.  Citi Bike-Sharing data for August 2019 will be used as the data set for analysis.  Pandas and python will be used to convert the data set "tripduration" attribute to the datetime format.

## Results

The map of NYC starting locations shows the high density in Manhattan which is the core city hub.  Working commuters, students and tourists would most likely be the main driver of the starting locations.

This chart shows the customer (individual sales) compared to the subscriber base by gender.  There are more subscribers than customers in the NYC bike-sharing program and males are the dominant subscriber base.  The subscriber option should be promoted in areas of high density of residents and commuters while the "customer" option would be more popular in tourist areas.



![Trip_Duration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JBro-Birds/bikesharing/master/support_images/Trip_Duration.png)
This chart clearly shows that most trip durations are less than an hour.  This result is expected since trip durations longer than an hour would drive most individuals to find motorised means of transportation.
