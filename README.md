# City Bike-Sharing:  Analyzing NYC City Bike-Sharing Data to Pitch Bike-Sharing in Des Moines, Iowa. 

## Overview of Project
Kate suggests that you use Citi Bike data that has been released to the public for your analysis. You agree, but then remind her that you must be cautious when looking at the data, as it applies specifically to New York City—Des Moines is quite different!

You're excited to find out which data will and will not apply to Des Moines, drawing on both your data expertise and critical thinking skills. You'll also need to rely on Kate's salesmanship during the investor conversations. Kate can sell almost anything, but it's up to you to make sure she's selling something viable.

Now you need to get some relevant data that you can use to help predict if your bike-share company idea could work in Des Moines. For this you'll need to turn to your data source: the Citi Bike data.

Since August can be a good month to visit New York City, next we'll figure out the peak hours for bike trips during the month of August. This will help our investors get a ballpark estimate of how many bikes we might need in Des Moines.
A key piece of data we need is the peak usage hours for the month of August. This will help us get a better idea of how many bikes we might need in Des Moines, as well as figure out during which parts of the day we'll need the most bikes. For example, if we need to do maintenance on a bike, knowing the peak usage hours will help us plan for the best time to do that.

### Purpose
